# Mern Auth

Mern Auth is a demo project to show how to create a basic app with a log in including some basic security features. Routes are tested using Postman, and state is handled using Redux

This app will allow users to:

* Register
* Log in
* Access protected pages only accessible to logged in users
* Stay logged in when they close the app or refresh the page
* Log out

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install Mern Auth.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the application create a .env file with the necessary connections to either your local mongoDB or your  Mongo Atlas connection

```javascript
nodemon run server

```
